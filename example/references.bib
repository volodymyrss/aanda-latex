  abstract = {At the talk presented on International Astrophysical Consortium of High Energy Calibration (IACHEC) meeting I describe a concept and a prototype of~ reusable cross-calibration workflows for inter-calibration of astrophysical experimentation. I suggest to define and allow a~dynamically composed unit tests for data and data analysis, establishing a platform for automated comparison and validation of scientific data and data analysis methods. These functions are among the core activities of ground segments (and especially Data Centers)~ of astrophysical experiments and observatories.},
